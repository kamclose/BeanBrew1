# Ideas for future improvement 
1 - I would like to add a MENU tab for customers to see how much each item would cost to order.
2 - Implement a SIGN UP / LOG IN system for tracking, promotion, and eventually online sales.
3 - Upgrade  the MENU tab to a functional ORDER ONLINE tab, utilizing the previous updates.
